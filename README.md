# first-repo
This is my first GitHub repo - trying to figure this out.

Use \# characters to create headings.  The more \# the higher the heading number (think like h1, h2, h3... HTML elements)

Use a single \` character to start and end `inline code examples` or use three \` characters (fenced block) to create longer examples like this:

```
SELECT *
FROM mytable;
```

If you are writing in a specific language you can also use \`\`\`SQL or \`\`\`Stata to tell GitHub how to highlight the syntax for you:

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM mytable;
```

Once you've modified something you can submit a pull request, which means you are asking someone to "pull" your proposed changes into their codebase.
